<h1>Hand Tracking Volume Control</h1>

This project uses hand-tracking technology to control the volume of your computer. It is built using the MediaPipe library and Python.
<h3>Requirements</h3>

Before using this project, you must have the following installed on your computer:
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.6 or above</li>
    <li>OpenCV</li>
    <li>Mediapipe</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>pycaw</li>
</ul>
You can install the required packages by running the following command:

<code>pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw</code>

<h3>How to use</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository or download the source code as a zip file and extract it.</li>
    <li>Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code.</li>
    <li>Run the following command to start the program:</li>
    <code>python Hand-Tracking-Volume-Control.py</code>
    <li>Place your hand in front of the camera and move it up or down to control the volume.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The program is set up to work with the primary audio output device on your computer. If you have multiple output devices, you may need to modify the code to select the correct device.</li>
    <li>The hand-tracking technology used in this project relies on the camera feed to identify the location of the hand. Therefore, it may not work well in low-light conditions or if the hand is partially obstructed.</li>
</ul>
