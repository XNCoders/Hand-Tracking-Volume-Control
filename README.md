Hand Tracking Volume Control

This project uses hand-tracking technology to control the volume of your computer. It is built using the MediaPipe library and Python.
Requirements

Before using this project, you must have the following installed on your computer:

    Python 3.6 or above
    OpenCV
    Mediapipe
    NumPy
    pycaw

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw

How to use

    Clone the repository or download the source code as a zip file and extract it.

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code.

    Run the following command to start the program:

    mathematica

    python Hand-Tracking-Volume-Control.py

    Place your hand in front of the camera and move it up or down to control the volume.

Notes

    The program is set up to work with the primary audio output device on your computer. If you have multiple output devices, you may need to modify the code to select the correct device.

    The hand-tracking technology used in this project relies on the camera feed to identify the location of the hand. Therefore, it may not work well in low-light conditions or if the hand is partially obstructed.
